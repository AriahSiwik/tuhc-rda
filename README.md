# Rex Duodecim Angelus
Mod for the Unofficial Homestuck Collection that adds the fan animation Rex Duodecim Angelus into the comic, specifically after page 3763 (right before entering Scratch's apartment).  

This fan animation was not in any way made by me. The animation itself contains credits for everyone who worked on it, even when viewed inside of the comic.  

The original video is linked on its story page by default, though that can be disabled. You can also find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-19Up0dLzNw). 

## Installation
To install, put the `rda` *folder* in your mods directory.
