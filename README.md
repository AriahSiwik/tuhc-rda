# Rex Duodecim Angelus
Mod for the Unofficial Homestuck Collection that adds the fan animation, Rex Duodecim Angelus, to the comic at a location chosen in the settings.

By default, the animation is added after page 3763, right before entering Doc Scratch's apartment. This is the location recommended by the mod author.

This fan animation was not in any way made by me. The animation itself contains credits for everyone who worked on it, even when viewed inside of the comic.

By default, you can find a link to the original video on the flash page (I've used previously unused page 2399), however this can be disabled in the settings.

You can also find a link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-19Up0dLzNw). 

If you have any suggestions for alternate places to put the flash, please create an 'issue' on the github repository.

## Installation
To install, download the latest release from the `Releases` sidebar, and put the `rda` *folder* in your mods directory.
